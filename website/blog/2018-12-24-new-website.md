Every great open source project has great documentation.

That's why we're proud to announce that we've adopted a new website and design for our official documentation.

<!--truncate-->

We will still continue to maintain the documentation on our GitHub repository. In fact, our website will be generated with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/en), so our docs on GitHub will still be incorporated into this site!
