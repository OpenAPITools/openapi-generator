# 4.24.8.7 Models with Polymorphism Support
# The following example describes a Pet model that can represent either a cat or a dog, as distinguished by the petType property. Each type of pet has other properties beyond those of the base Pet model. An instance without a petType property, or with a petType property that does not match either cat or dog, is invalid.
