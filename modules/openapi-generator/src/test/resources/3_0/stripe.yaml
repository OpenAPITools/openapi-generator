        Secret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.

        The primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can't view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.

        All Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don't change per-user, like a third-party API key.

        A `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.

        These bank accounts are payment methods on `Customer` objects.

        On the other hand [External Accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts) are transfer
        destinations on `Account` objects for [Custom accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/custom-accounts).
        They can be bank accounts or debit cards as well, and are documented in the links above.

            For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`, `verified`, `verification_failed`, or `errored`. A bank account that hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isn’t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`. If a transfer sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send transfers until the bank details are updated.

            For external accounts, possible values are `new` and `errored`. Validations aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply. If a transfer fails, the status is set to `errored` and transfers are stopped until account details are updated.

        The Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and
        billing management.

        A portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you
        want to provide to your customers through the portal.

        A portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for
        a particular customer. By visiting the session's URL, the customer
        can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons,
        sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL.
        Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions
        and billing details.

        Learn more in the [integration guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/integrating-customer-portal).

    event:
      description: |-
        Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in
        your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event`
        object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`
        event; and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
        `invoice.payment_failed` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple
        events to be created. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
        customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
        `charge.succeeded` event.

        Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that
        resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For
        example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an
        `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice.

        As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
        [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)
        from the API. We also have a separate
        [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the
        `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are managed
        in your
        [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks),
        and our [Using Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) guide will help you get set up.

        When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive notifications of
        events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an
        additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.

        **NOTE:** Right now, access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) is
        guaranteed only for 30 days.

        `Exchange Rate` objects allow you to determine the rates that Stripe is
        currently using to convert from one currency to another. Since this number is
        variable throughout the day, there are various reasons why you might want to
        know the current rate (for example, to dynamically price an item for a user
        with a default payment in a foreign currency).

        If you want a guarantee that the charge is made with a certain exchange rate
        you expect is current, you can pass in `exchange_rate` to charges endpoints.
        If the value is no longer up to date, the charge won't go through. Please

        A VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user.
        The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options`
        parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the
        appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.

        Each VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as
        reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://stripe.com/docs/api/files)
        API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the
        [VerificationSession](https://stripe.com/docs/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.

        A VerificationSession guides you through the process of collecting and verifying the identities
        of your users. It contains details about the type of verification, such as what [verification
        check](/docs/identity/verification-checks) to perform. Only create one VerificationSession for
        each verification in your system.

        A VerificationSession transitions through [multiple
        statuses](/docs/identity/how-sessions-work) throughout its lifetime as it progresses through
        the verification flow. The VerificationSession contains the user's verified data after
        verification checks are complete.

    invoice:
      description: |-
        Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
        generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.

        They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
        that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).

        If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
        Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
        that finalizing the invoice,
        [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/workflow/#auto_advance), does
        not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
        until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
        webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
        connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
        creation to finalize the invoice.

        If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
        [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
        Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
        emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.

        Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
        amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
        charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
        per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
        invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
        customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.

        More details on the customer's credit balance are
        [here](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance).

        Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually
        charge or credit the customer's card only at the end of a regular billing
        cycle. This is useful for combining several charges (to minimize
        per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing

    payment_intent:
      description: |-
        A PaymentIntent guides you through the process of collecting a payment from your customer.
        We recommend that you create exactly one PaymentIntent for each order or
        customer session in your system. You can reference the PaymentIntent later to
        see the history of payment attempts for a particular session.

        A PaymentIntent transitions through
        [multiple statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses)
        throughout its lifetime as it interfaces with Stripe.js to perform
        authentication flows and ultimately creates at most one successful charge.

        Related guide: [Payment Intents API](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents).
      properties:
        amount:

            integer representing how much to charge in the [smallest currency unit](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#zero-decimal)
            (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal
            currency). The minimum amount is $0.50 US or [equivalent in charge currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts).
            The amount value supports up to eight digits (e.g., a value of 99999999
            for a USD charge of $999,999.99).

        A payment link is a shareable URL that will take your customers to a hosted payment page. A payment link can be shared and used multiple times.

        When a customer opens a payment link it will open a new [checkout session](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions) to render the payment page. You can use [checkout session events](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed) to track payments through payment links.

        You can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.

        Plans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products.
        [Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.

        For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.

        Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of products.
        [Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by prices. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.

        For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and €9 once.

        The Report Run object represents an instance of a report type generated with
        specific run parameters. Once the object is created, Stripe begins processing the report.
        When the report has finished running, it will give you a reference to a file
        where you can retrieve your results. For an overview, see
        [API Access to Reports](https://stripe.com/docs/reporting/statements/api).

        Note that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode

        A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
        For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
        Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.

        Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
        Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
        The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
        you through the setup process.

        Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
        For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
        [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
        in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
        If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success,
        it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer.
        We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
        PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.

        By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of required friction,
        even as regulations change over time.

        `Source` objects allow you to accept a variety of payment methods. They
        represent a customer's payment instrument, and can be used with the Stripe API
        just like a `Card` object: once chargeable, they can be charged, or can be
        attached to customers.

        Stripe doesn't recommend using the deprecated [Sources API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/sources).
        We recommend that you adopt the [PaymentMethods API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_methods).
        This newer API provides access to our latest features and payment method types.

        Related guides: [Sources API](https://stripe.com/docs/sources) and [Sources & Customers](https://stripe.com/docs/sources/customers).

    token:
      description: |-
        Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank
        account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from
        your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is
        returned to your server to use. You should use our
        [recommended payments integrations](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) to perform this process
        client-side. This ensures that no sensitive card data touches your server,
        and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.

        If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using
        the API with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if
        your integration uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance
        that may be required, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with
        client-side tokenization, your customer's information is not sent directly to
        Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is handled or stored.

        Tokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account
        information for later use, you can create [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)
        objects or [Custom accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts). Note that
        [Radar](https://stripe.com/docs/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection,
        performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.

        A `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as
        part of Connect.

        Before April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a
        Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split
        out into a [Payout](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more
        information, read about the
        [transfer/payout split](https://stripe.com/docs/transfer-payout-split).

        [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect) platforms can reverse transfers made to a
        connected account, either entirely or partially, and can also specify whether
        to refund any related application fees. Transfer reversals add to the
        platform's balance and subtract from the destination account's balance.

        Reversing a transfer that was made for a [destination
        charge](/docs/connect/destination-charges) is allowed only up to the amount of
        the charge. It is possible to reverse a
        [transfer_group](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges-transfers#transfer-options)
        transfer only if the destination account has enough balance to cover the
        reversal.

                    on the Checkout page. In `subscription` mode, the customer’s [default payment method](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method)
                    will be used if it’s a card, and otherwise the most recent card will be used. A valid billing address, billing name and billing email are required on the payment method for Checkout to prefill the customer's card details.

                    If the Customer already has a valid [email](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object#customer_object-email) set, the email will be prefilled and not editable in Checkout.
                    If the Customer does not have a valid `email`, Checkout will set the email entered during the session on the Customer.

                    If blank for Checkout Sessions in `payment` or `subscription` mode, Checkout will create a new Customer object based on information provided during the payment flow.

                    You can set [`payment_intent_data.setup_future_usage`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-setup_future_usage) to have Checkout automatically attach the payment method to the Customer you pass in for future reuse.

                    A list of the types of payment methods (e.g., `card`) this Checkout Session can accept.

                    In `payment` and `subscription` mode, you can omit this attribute to manage your payment methods from the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).
                    It is required in `setup` mode.

                    Read more about the supported payment methods and their requirements in our [payment
                    method details guide](/docs/payments/checkout/payment-methods).

                    If multiple payment methods are passed, Checkout will dynamically reorder them to
                    prioritize the most relevant payment methods based on the customer's location and
                    other characteristics.

        <p>Issue a credit note to adjust the amount of a finalized invoice. For a <code>status=open</code> invoice, a credit note reduces
        its <code>amount_due</code>. For a <code>status=paid</code> invoice, a credit note does not affect its <code>amount_due</code>. Instead, it can result
        in any combination of the following:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Refund: create a new refund (using <code>refund_amount</code>) or link an existing refund (using <code>refund</code>).</li>
        <li>Customer balance credit: credit the customer’s balance (using <code>credit_amount</code>) which will be automatically applied to their next invoice when it’s finalized.</li>
        <li>Outside of Stripe credit: record the amount that is or will be credited outside of Stripe (using <code>out_of_band_amount</code>).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For post-payment credit notes the sum of the refund, credit and outside of Stripe amounts must equal the credit note total.</p>

        <p>You may issue multiple credit notes for an invoice. Each credit note will increment the invoice’s <code>pre_payment_credit_notes_amount</code>

        <p>Updates the specified customer by setting the values of the parameters passed. Any parameters not provided will be left unchanged. For example, if you pass the <strong>source</strong> parameter, that becomes the customer’s active source (e.g., a card) to be used for all charges in the future. When you update a customer to a new valid card source by passing the <strong>source</strong> parameter: for each of the customer’s current subscriptions, if the subscription bills automatically and is in the <code>past_due</code> state, then the latest open invoice for the subscription with automatic collection enabled will be retried. This retry will not count as an automatic retry, and will not affect the next regularly scheduled payment for the invoice. Changing the <strong>default_source</strong> for a customer will not trigger this behavior.</p>

        <p>This request accepts mostly the same arguments as the customer creation call.</p>

                    Only applies to subscriptions with `collection_method=charge_automatically`.

                    Use `allow_incomplete` to create subscriptions with `status=incomplete` if the first invoice cannot be paid. Creating subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

                    Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.

                    Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

                    `pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be passed when creating a subscription.

                    Subscriptions with `collection_method=send_invoice` are automatically activated regardless of the first invoice status.

        <p>Cancels a customer’s subscription. If you set the <code>at_period_end</code> parameter to <code>true</code>, the subscription will remain active until the end of the period, at which point it will be canceled and not renewed. Otherwise, with the default <code>false</code> value, the subscription is terminated immediately. In either case, the customer will not be charged again for the subscription.</p>

        <p>Note, however, that any pending invoice items that you’ve created will still be charged for at the end of the period, unless manually <a href="#delete_invoiceitem">deleted</a>. If you’ve set the subscription to cancel at the end of the period, any pending prorations will also be left in place and collected at the end of the period. But if the subscription is set to cancel immediately, pending prorations will be removed.</p>

        <p>By default, upon subscription cancellation, Stripe will stop automatic collection of all finalized invoices for the customer. This is intended to prevent unexpected payment attempts after the customer has canceled a subscription. However, you can resume automatic collection of the invoices manually after subscription cancellation to have us proceed. Or, you could check for unpaid invoices before allowing the customer to cancel the subscription at all.</p>

                    Use `allow_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` if a payment is required but cannot be paid. This allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

                    Use `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.

                    Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).

                    Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

        <p>When you get a dispute, contacting your customer is always the best first step. If that doesn’t work, you can submit evidence to help us resolve the dispute in your favor. You can do this in your <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes">dashboard</a>, but if you prefer, you can use the API to submit evidence programmatically.</p>

        <p>Depending on your dispute type, different evidence fields will give you a better chance of winning your dispute. To figure out which evidence fields to provide, see our <a href="/docs/disputes/categories">guide to dispute types</a>.</p>

        <p>At any time, you can preview the upcoming invoice for a customer. This will show you all the charges that are pending, including subscription renewal charges, invoice item charges, etc. It will also show you any discounts that are applicable to the invoice.</p>

        <p>Note that when you are viewing an upcoming invoice, you are simply viewing a preview – the invoice has not yet been created. As such, the upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount.</p>

        <p>You can preview the effects of updating a subscription, including a preview of what proration will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass a <code>proration_date</code> parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The value passed in should be the same as the <code>subscription_proration_date</code> returned on the upcoming invoice resource. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed is to consider only proration line items where <code>period[start]</code> is equal to the <code>subscription_proration_date</code> on the upcoming invoice resource.</p>

        <p>Creates a PaymentIntent object.</p>

        <p>After the PaymentIntent is created, attach a payment method and <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm">confirm</a>
        to continue the payment. You can read more about the different payment flows
        available via the Payment Intents API <a href="/docs/payments/payment-intents">here</a>.</p>

        <p>When <code>confirm=true</code> is used during creation, it is equivalent to creating
        and confirming the PaymentIntent in the same call. You may use any parameters
        available in the <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm">confirm API</a> when <code>confirm=true</code>
        is supplied.</p>

If no Customer was provided, the payment method can still be [attached](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_methods/attach) to a Customer after the transaction completes.

        <p>Confirm that your customer intends to pay with current or provided
        payment method. Upon confirmation, the PaymentIntent will attempt to initiate
        a payment.
        If the selected payment method requires additional authentication steps, the
        PaymentIntent will transition to the <code>requires_action</code> status and
        suggest additional actions via <code>next_action</code>. If payment fails,
        the PaymentIntent will transition to the <code>requires_payment_method</code> status. If
        payment succeeds, the PaymentIntent will transition to the <code>succeeded</code>
        status (or <code>requires_capture</code>, if <code>capture_method</code> is set to <code>manual</code>).
        If the <code>confirmation_method</code> is <code>automatic</code>, payment may be attempted
        using our <a href="/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-handle-card-payment">client SDKs</a>
        and the PaymentIntent’s <a href="#payment_intent_object-client_secret">client_secret</a>.
        After <code>next_action</code>s are handled by the client, no additional
        confirmation is required to complete the payment.
        If the <code>confirmation_method</code> is <code>manual</code>, all payment attempts must be
        initiated using a secret key.
        If any actions are required for the payment, the PaymentIntent will
        return to the <code>requires_confirmation</code> state
        after those actions are completed. Your server needs to then
        explicitly re-confirm the PaymentIntent to initiate the next payment
        attempt. Read the <a href="/docs/payments/payment-intents/web-manual">expanded documentation</a>
        to learn more about manual confirmation.</p>

        initial authorization, incremental authorizations may be declined. A
        single PaymentIntent can call this endpoint multiple times to further
        increase the authorized amount.</p>

        If the incremental authorization fails, a

                    Specify whether Checkout should collect a payment method. When set to `if_required`, Checkout will not collect a payment method when the total due for the session is 0.This may occur if the Checkout Session includes a free trial or a discount.

                    Can only be set in `subscription` mode.

                    If you'd like information on how to collect a payment method outside of Checkout, read the guide on [configuring subscriptions with a free trial](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/free-trials).

        <p>Attaches a PaymentMethod object to a Customer.</p>

        <p>To attach a new PaymentMethod to a customer for future payments, we recommend you use a <a href="/docs/api/setup_intents">SetupIntent</a>
        or a PaymentIntent with <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage">setup_future_usage</a>.
        These approaches will perform any necessary steps to set up the PaymentMethod for future payments. Using the <code>/v1/payment_methods/:id/attach</code>
        endpoint without first using a SetupIntent or PaymentIntent with <code>setup_future_usage</code> does not optimize the PaymentMethod for
        future use, which makes later declines and payment friction more likely.
        See <a href="/docs/payments/payment-intents#future-usage">Optimizing cards for future payments</a> for more information about setting up
        future payments.</p>

        <p>To use this PaymentMethod as the default for invoice or subscription payments,
        set <a href="/docs/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method"><code>invoice_settings.default_payment_method</code></a>,
        on the Customer to the PaymentMethod’s ID.</p>

                    Use `allow_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` if a payment is required but cannot be paid. This allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

                    Use `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.

                    Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).

                    Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.

                    Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).

                    Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

        <p>The default calculation for usage is to add up all the <code>quantity</code> values of the usage records within a billing period. You can change this default behavior with the billing plan’s <code>aggregate_usage</code> <a href="/docs/api/plans/create#create_plan-aggregate_usage">parameter</a>. When there is more than one usage record with the same timestamp, Stripe adds the <code>quantity</code> values together. In most cases, this is the desired resolution, however, you can change this behavior with the <code>action</code> parameter.</p>

                    Use `allow_incomplete` to create subscriptions with `status=incomplete` if the first invoice cannot be paid. Creating subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

                    Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.

                    Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

                    `pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be passed when creating a subscription.

                    Subscriptions with `collection_method=send_invoice` are automatically activated regardless of the first invoice status.

                    Use `allow_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` if a payment is required but cannot be paid. This allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

                    Use `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.

                    Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).

                    Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.
