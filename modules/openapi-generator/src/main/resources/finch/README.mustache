# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.  By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled scalatra server.

This example uses the [finch](http://github.com/finagle/finch/) framework.  To see how to make this your own, look here:

### After generation

Run `scalafix RemoveUnusedImports` to cleanup unused imports.
