/**
 * RegisterMiddlewares
 *
 * Recommendations from template creator:
 *
 * There is no way to add route related middlewares here, add global ones. Route related middlewares
 * can be applied in \{{appPackage}}\RegisterRoutes class.
 *
 * I add middlewares by full class names(\Slim\Middleware\ErrorMiddleware::class) because that way
 * Slim initiates them with options from Container. They already configured, don't need to pass any
 * options manually.
 *
 * I don't use imports(eg. use Slim\Middleware\ErrorMiddleware) here because each package unlikely
 * be used in code twice. It helps to keep that file short and make Git history cleaner.
 *
 * This class declared as final because two classes with middlewares can cause confusion. Edit
 * template of this class or use your own implementation instead(overwrite index.php to import your
 * custom class).
