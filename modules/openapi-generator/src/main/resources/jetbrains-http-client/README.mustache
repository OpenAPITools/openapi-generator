# {{appName}} - Jetbrains API Client

## General API description

{{#appDescription}}{{appDescription}}{{/appDescription}}

* API basepath : [{{basePath}}]({{basePath}})
* Version : {{version}}

## Documentation for API Endpoints

{{#generateApiDocs}}
All URIs are relative to *{{{basePath}}}*, but will link to the `.http` file that contains the endpoint definition.
There may be multiple requests for a single endpoint, one for each example described in the OpenAPI specification.

Class | Method | HTTP request | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
{{#apiInfo}}{{#apis}}{{#operations}}{{#operation}}*{{classname}}* | [**{{operationId}}**](Apis/{{apiDocPath}}{{classname}}.http#{{operationIdLowerCase}}) | **{{httpMethod}}** {{path}} | {{#summary}}{{{summary}}}{{/summary}}

## Usage

### Prerequisites

You need [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to be able to run those queries. More information can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html).
You may have some luck running queries using the [Code REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) as well, but your mileage may vary.

### Variables and Environment files

* Generally speaking, you want queries to be specific using custom variables. All variables in the `.http` files have the `{{VAR}}` format.
* You can create [public or private environment files](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/exploring-http-syntax.html#environment-variables) to dynamically replace the variables at runtime.

_Note: don't commit private environment files! They typically will contain sensitive information like API Keys._

### Customizations

If you have control over the generation of the files here, there are two main things you can do

* Select elements to replace as variables during generation. The process is case-sensitive. For example, API_KEY -> {{API_KEY}}
    * For this, run the generation with the `bodyVariables` property, followed by a "-" separated list of variables
    * Example: `--additional-properties bodyVariables=YOUR_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT-YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT-YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM`
* Add custom headers to _all_ requests. This can be useful for example if your specifications are missing [security schemes](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/issues/237).
    * For this, run the generation with the `customHeaders` property, followed by a "&" separated list of variables
    * Example : `--additional-properties=customHeaders="Cookie:X-API-KEY={{cookieKey}}"&"Accept-Encoding=gzip"`
