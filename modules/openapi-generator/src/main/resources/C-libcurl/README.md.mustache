## Installation
You'll need the `curl 7.58.0` package in order to build the API. To have code formatted nicely you also need to have uncrustify version 0.67.

# Prerequisites

## Install the `curl 7.58.0` package with the following command on Linux.
```bash
sudo apt remove curl
wget http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.58.0.tar.gz
tar -xvf curl-7.58.0.tar.gz
cd curl-7.58.0/
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
## Install the `uncrustify 0.67` package with the following command on Linux.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify.git
cd uncrustify
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

## Compile the sample:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
// To install library to specific location use following command
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/pathtolocaiton ..
// for normal install use following command
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```
## How to use compiled library
Considering the test/source code which uses the API is written in main.c(respective api include is written and all objects necessary are defined)

To compile main.c use following command
-L - locaiton of the library(not required if cmake with normal installation is performed)
-l library name
```bash
gcc main.c -L. -lpetstore -o main
```
