# OpenAPI generated server

## Requirements
* PHP 7.1.3 or newer

## Overview
This server was generated by the [openapi-generator](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator) project.  By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a PHP server.

This example uses the [laravel Framework](http://laravel.com/).  To see how to make this your own, please take a look at the template here:
