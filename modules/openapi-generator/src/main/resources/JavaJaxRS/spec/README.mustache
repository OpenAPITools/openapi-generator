# JAX-RS server with OpenAPI

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using an
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.

This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled JAX-RS server.
This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.

{{#interfaceOnly}}
This project produces a jar that defines some interfaces.
The jar can be used in combination with an other project providing the implementation.

{{^interfaceOnly}}
The JAX-RS implementation needs to be provided by the application server you are deploying on.

To run the server from the command line, you can use maven to provision an start a TomEE Server.
Please execute the following:

```
mvn -Dtomee-embedded-plugin.http={{serverPort}} package org.apache.tomee.maven:tomee-embedded-maven-plugin:7.0.5:run
```

You can then call your server endpoints under:

```
http://localhost:{{serverPort}}{{contextPath}}/
```

Note that if you have configured the `host` to be something other than localhost, the calls through
swagger-ui will be directed to that host and not localhost!
