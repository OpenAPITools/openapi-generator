# JAX-RS server with OpenAPI using KumuluzEE

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using an
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.

This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled JAX-RS server.
This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework and
the [Eclipse-MicroProfile-OpenAPI](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api) addition.

The pom file is configured to use [KumuluzEE](https://ee.kumuluz.com/) as application server.

To build the server, run this maven command:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

To run the server, run this maven command:

```bash
java -jar target/${project.build.finalName}.jar
```

You can then call your server endpoints under:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Example endpoint:

```
http://localhost:8080/v2/user/example
```
