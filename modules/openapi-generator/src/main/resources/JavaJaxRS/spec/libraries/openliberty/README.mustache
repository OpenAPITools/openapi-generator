# JAX-RS server with OpenAPI using Open Liberty

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using an
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.

This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled JAX-RS server.
This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework and
the [Eclipse-MicroProfile-OpenAPI](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api) addition.

The pom file is configured to use [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/) as application server.

{{#interfaceOnly}}
This project produces a jar that defines some interfaces.
The jar can be used in combination with an other project providing the implementation.

```

A UI for this OpenAPI Specification is available at:

```
http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui
