# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled JAX-RS server.

This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework for Jboss Resteasy.

You can deploy the WAR file to Jboss EAP or any other JEE server supporting Jboss Resteasy.

You can then view the swagger listing here:

```
http://localhost:{{serverPort}}{{contextPath}}/openapi.json
```

Note that if you have configured the `host` to be something other than localhost, the calls through
swagger-ui will be directed to that host and not localhost!
