# OpenAPITools generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a PHP server.

This example uses the [Lumen Framework](http://lumen.laravel.com/).  To see how to make this your own, please take a look at the template here:

[TEMPLATES](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/lumen/)

## Installation & Usage
### Composer

Switch to the generated Lumen server stub directory.
Using `composer update` to install the framework and dependencies via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

## Note

The `composer update` should be the first thing to do right after generating Lumen server stub. The autoload.php will be generated only after excuting `composer update`.
Or there would be errors during service or model migration.

### Running the generated server stub

```bash
php -S localhost:8080 public/index.php
```
