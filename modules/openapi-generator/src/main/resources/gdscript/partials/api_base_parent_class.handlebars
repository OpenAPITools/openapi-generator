Override this template to let Apis inherit from your own desired class.
You can for example use Node here of you want to use Apis as Autoloads,
or provide the class_name of your own custom class, or even a quoted filepath.
Anything that goes after the `extends` statement will work.
TODO: would be nice to be able to customize this parent class from CLI.
