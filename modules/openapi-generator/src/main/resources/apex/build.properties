# The first three properties (SF_USERNAME, SF_PASSWORD, SF_SESSIONID) may either be specified below
# or set from environment variables of the same names. The remaining non-uppercase properties, which
# have the "sf." prefix (e.g.: sf.serverurl) may only be specified in this file and not from
# environment variables.

# Required if sessionId isn't specified. The Salesforce username for login. The username associated
# with this connection must have the "Modify All Data" permission. Typically, this is only enabled
# for System Administrator users.
#
# SF_USERNAME = username@example.com

# Required if sessionId isn't specified. The password you use to log in to the org associated with
# this project. If you are using a security token, paste the 25-digit token value to the end of your
# password.
#
# SF_PASSWORD = password123

# Required if username and password aren't specified. The ID of an active Salesforce session or the
# OAuth access token. A session is created after a user logs in to Salesforce successfully with a
# username and password. Use a session ID for logging in to an existing session instead of creating
# a new session. Alternatively, use an access token for OAuth authentication. For more information,
# see Authenticating Apps with OAuth in the Salesforce Help.
#
# SF_SESSIONID = 0000...

# Optional. The Salesforce server URL (if blank, defaults to login.salesforce.com). To connect to a
# sandbox instance, change this to test.salesforce.com.
#
sf.serverurl = test.salesforce.com

# Optional. Defaults to 200. The number of times to poll the server for the results of the deploy
# request. Note that deployment can succeed even if you stop waiting.
#
sf.maxPoll = 200
