## Overview
This client was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
It uses the [KumuluzEE](https://ee.kumuluz.com) framework together with the [KumuluzEE Rest Client](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-rest-client)
project, which provides a type-safe way of calling REST services.

The generated client contains a set of interfaces for calling the endpoints defined in the OpenAPI specification. The
interfaces can be injected into dependent classes and its methods can be used to call the REST service's endpoints.
The detailed description on using the KumuluzEE Rest Client can be found
[here](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-rest-client/blob/master/README.md).

By default, the client is configured to use "localhost:8080/v2" as the server URL (the default URL of the JAX-RS
server generated with this generator). You can change this in the config.yaml file.

To build the client, run this maven command:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

To run the client, run this maven command:

```bash
java -jar target/${project.build.finalName}.jar
```
