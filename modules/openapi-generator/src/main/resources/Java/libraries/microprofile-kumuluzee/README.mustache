## Overview
This API client was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
[KumuluzEE Rest Client](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-rest-client) is a type-safe way of calling
REST services implemented in the [KumuluzEE](https://ee.kumuluz.com) framework. The generated client contains an interface which acts as the client, you can inject it into dependent classes.

To build the client, run this maven command:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

To run the client, run this maven command:

```bash
java -jar target/${project.build.finalName}.jar
```

By default, the client interface is configured to use "localhost:8080/v2" as the server URL (the default URL of the JAX-RS
server generated with this generator). You can change this in the config.yaml file.

```
http://localhost:8080/v2
```
