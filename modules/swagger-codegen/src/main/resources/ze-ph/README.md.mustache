# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub. This
is an example of building a PHP server.

This example uses the [Zend Expressive](https://zendframework.github.io/zend-expressive) micro framework and [Path Handler](https://github.com/Articus/PathHandler) library. To see how to make this your own, please take a look at the template here:
