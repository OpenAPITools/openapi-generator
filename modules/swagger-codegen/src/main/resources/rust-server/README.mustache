## Overview
This client/server was generated by the [swagger-codegen]
(https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

## Examples

Run examples with:

```
cargo run --example <example-name>
```

To pass in arguments to the examples, put them after `--`, for example:

```
cargo run --example client -- --help
```

### Running the server
To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
cargo run --example server
```

### Running a client
To run a client, follow one of the following simple steps:

```{{#apiInfo}}{{#apis}}{{#operations}}{{#operation}}
cargo run --example client {{operationId}}{{/operation}}{{/operations}}{{/apis}}{{/apiInfo}}
```

### HTTPS
The examples can be run in HTTPS mode by passing in the flag `--https`, for example:

```
cargo run --example server -- --https
```

This will use the keys/certificates from the examples directory. Note that the server chain is signed with
`CN=localhost`.
