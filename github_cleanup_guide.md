This guide provides step-by-step instructions for downloading, cleaning, and re-uploading your GitHub repository.

## **Step 1: Download Your Repository**

### **Option A: Using Git**
1. Open a terminal on your device (e.g., in PythonEditor or another app).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Okeamah/<repo-name>.git
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

### **Option B: Download as ZIP**
1. Open your browser and navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click the green **"Code"** button and select **"Download ZIP"**.
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your device.

## **Step 2: Clean Up Your Repository**

1. Navigate to the extracted repository folder (for ZIP) or the cloned folder (for Git).
2. Remove unwanted files or directories:
   - Using a file manager, delete files manually.
   - Using Git, run:
     ```bash
     rm <file-name>
     ```
3. Update content like the `README.md` file if needed.

## **Step 3: Re-upload Your Repository**

### **Option A: Using Git**
1. Stage and commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Cleaned up repository"
   ```
2. Push changes back to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

### **Option B: Using ZIP**
1. Compress the cleaned folder into a new ZIP file.
2. Open your browser and go to your GitHub repository.
3. Drag and drop the cleaned files (not the ZIP) into the repository interface.
4. Commit the changes.

## **Step 4: Optional - Clean Up Branches**

### **Delete Old Branches Locally**
1. View all branches:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```
2. Delete unwanted branches:
   ```bash
   git branch -d <branch-name>
   ```

### **Delete Old Branches Remotely**
1. View remote branches:
   ```bash
   git branch -r
   ```
2. Delete unwanted remote branches:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete <branch-name>
   ```

---

## **Step 5: Backup Your Cleaned Repository**

1. Rename your current repository on GitHub (e.g., to `repo-name-old`):
   - Go to **Settings** in the repository.
   - Rename it under **Repository name**.
2. Create a new repository for the cleaned version (e.g., `repo-name-clean`).
3. Link your cleaned local repository to the new remote:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Okeamah/<new-repo-name>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
