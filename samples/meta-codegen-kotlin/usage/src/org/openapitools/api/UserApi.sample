# This is a sample api mustache template.  It is representing a ficticous 
# language and won't be usable or compile to anything without lots of changes.
# Use it as an example.  You can access the variables in the generator object
# like such:

# use the package from the `apiPackage` variable
package: org.openapitools.api

# operations block
classname: UserApi

# loop over each operation in the API:

# each operation has an `operationId`:
operationId: createUser

# and parameters:
body: User


# each operation has an `operationId`:
operationId: createUsersWithArrayInput

# and parameters:
body: List


# each operation has an `operationId`:
operationId: createUsersWithListInput

# and parameters:
body: List


# each operation has an `operationId`:
operationId: deleteUser

# and parameters:
username: String


# each operation has an `operationId`:
operationId: getUserByName

# and parameters:

# each operation has an `operationId`:

# and parameters:

# each operation has an `operationId`:
