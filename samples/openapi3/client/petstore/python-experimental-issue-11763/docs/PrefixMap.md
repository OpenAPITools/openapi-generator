# PrefixMap

JSON format prefix map, used to expand prefixes in the 'object' expression.  A JSON format prefix map is a JSON object whose keys are prefixes without the colon separator (e.g., \\\"owl\\\"), and whose values are IRI prefixes (typically WITH the hash-mark, \\\"#\\\" suffix).  Because these are passed as parameters, they may need to be URL-encoded to pass over HTTP.
