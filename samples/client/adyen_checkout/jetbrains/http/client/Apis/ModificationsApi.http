## Cancels the authorisation on a payment that has not yet been [captured](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/captures), and returns a unique reference for this request. You get the outcome of the request asynchronously, in a [**TECHNICAL_CANCEL** webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/cancel#cancellation-webhook).  If you want to cancel a payment using the [&#x60;pspReference&#x60;](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments__resParam_pspReference), use the [&#x60;/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels&#x60;](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels) endpoint instead.  If you want to cancel a payment but are not sure whether it has been captured, use the [&#x60;/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals&#x60;](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals) endpoint instead.

### Update an authorised amount
## Increases or decreases the authorised payment amount and returns a unique reference for this request.

You can only update authorised amounts that have not yet been [captured](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/captures).  The amount you specify in the request is the updated amount, which is larger or smaller than the initial authorised amount.

If you want to cancel a payment but don&#39;t have the [&#x60;pspReference&#x60;](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments__resParam_pspReference), use the [&#x60;/cancels&#x60;](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/cancels) endpoint instead.

### Capture an authorised payment
##  Captures an authorised payment and returns a unique reference for this request. You get the outcome of the request asynchronously, in a [**CAPTURE** webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/capture#capture-notification).  You can capture either the full authorised amount or a part of the authorised amount. By default, any unclaimed amount after a partial capture gets cancelled. This does not apply if you enabled multiple partial captures on your account and the payment method supports multiple partial captures.   [Automatic capture](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/capture#automatic-capture) is the default setting for most payment methods. In these cases, you don&#39;t need to make capture requests. However, making capture requests for payments that are captured automatically does not result in double charges.  For more information, refer to [Capture](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/capture).

You get the outcome of the request asynchronously, in a [**REFUND** webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/refund#refund-webhook).  You can refund either the full captured amount or a part of the captured amount. You can also perform multiple partial refunds, as long as their sum doesn&#39;t exceed the captured amount.  &gt; Some payment methods do not support partial refunds. To learn if a payment method supports partial refunds, refer to the payment method page such as [cards](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/cards#supported-cards), [iDEAL](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/ideal), or [Klarna](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/klarna).   If you want to refund a payment but are not sure whether it has been captured, use the [&#x60;/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals&#x60;](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals) endpoint instead.  For more information, refer to [Refund](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/refund).

Returns a unique reference for this request. You get the outcome of the request asynchronously, in a [**CANCEL_OR_REFUND** webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/reverse#cancel-or-refund-webhook).  The reversed amount is always the full payment amount. &gt; Do not use this request for payments that involve multiple partial captures.  For more information, refer to [Reversal](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/reversal).
