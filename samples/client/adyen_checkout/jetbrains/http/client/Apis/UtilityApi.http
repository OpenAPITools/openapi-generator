### Get an Apple Pay session
## You need to use this endpoint if you have an API-only integration with Apple Pay which uses Adyen&#39;s Apple Pay certificate.  The endpoint returns the Apple Pay session data which you need to complete the [Apple Pay session validation](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/api-only?tab&#x3D;adyen-certificate-validation_1#complete-apple-pay-session-validation).

### Create originKey values for domains
## This operation takes the origin domains and returns a JSON object containing the corresponding origin keys for the domains.  &gt; If you&#39;re still using origin key for your Web Drop-in or Components integration, we recommend [switching to client key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/client-side-authentication/migrate-from-origin-key-to-client-key). This allows you to use a single key for all origins, add or remove origins without generating a new key, and detect the card type from the number entered in your payment form.
