# REST API Client for OpenAPI Petstore

## Overview
This API Client was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
It uses the [Oat++](https://github.com/oatpp/oatpp) Framework.

## Files organization
The Oat++ C++ REST client generator creates two folders:
- `api`: This folder contains the handlers for each method specified in the OpenAPI definition. Every handler extracts
the path and parameters (if any) from the request issue them against the server.
- `model`: This folder contains the corresponding class for every object schema found in the OpenAPI specification.

The main folder contains also a file with a main that can be used to issue REST requests through the client.
Of course, is you should customize this file based on your needs
