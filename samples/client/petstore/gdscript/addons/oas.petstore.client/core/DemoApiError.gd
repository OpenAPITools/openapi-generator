# Error wrapper provided to error callbacks
# =========================================
#
# Whenever this OAS client fails to comply to your request, for any reason,
# it will trigger the error callback, with an instance of this as parameter.
#

## Helps finding the error in the code, among other things.
## Could be a UUID, or even a translation key, so long as it's unique.
## Right now we're mostly using a lowercase ~namespace joined by dots. (.)
@export var identifier := ""

## A message for humans.  May be multiline.
@export var message := ""

## One of Godot's ERR_XXXX, when relevant.
@export var internal_code := OK

## The HTTP response code, if any.  (usually >= 400)
## DEPRECATED: prefer reading from response object below
@export var response_code := HTTPClient.RESPONSE_OK

## The HTTP response, if any.
@export var response: DemoApiResponse
