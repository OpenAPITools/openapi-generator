/**
 Presents a view controller modally.

 If the view controller is one of the following:

  - MFMailComposeViewController
  - MFMessageComposeViewController
  - UIImagePickerController
  - SLComposeViewController

 Then PromiseKit presents the view controller returning a promise that is
 resolved as per the documentation for those classes. Eg. if you present a
 `UIImagePickerController` the view controller will be presented for you
 and the returned promise will resolve with the media the user selected.

    [self promiseViewController:[MFMailComposeViewController new] animated:YES completion:nil].then(^{
        //â€¦
    });

 Otherwise PromiseKit expects your view controller to implement a
 `promise` property. This promise will be returned from this method and
 presentation and dismissal of the presented view controller will be
 managed for you.
