## Installation

The suggested installation method is via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```sh
php composer.phar require "doctrine/instantiator:~1.0.3"
```

## Usage

The instantiator is able to create new instances of any class without using the constructor or any API of the class
itself:

```php
$instantiator = new \Doctrine\Instantiator\Instantiator();

$instance = $instantiator->instantiate('My\\ClassName\\Here');
```
