test: Simple Inline Array
brief: >
    Sequences can be contained on a
    single line, using the inline syntax.
    Separate each entry with commas and
    enclose in square brackets.
yaml: |
    seq: [ a, b, c ]
php: |
    array('seq' => array('a', 'b', 'c'))
---
test: Simple Inline Hash
brief: >
    Mapping can also be contained on
    a single line, using the inline
    syntax.  Each key-value pair is
    separated by a colon, with a comma
    between each entry in the mapping.
    Enclose with curly braces.
yaml: |
    hash: { name: Steve, foo: bar }
php: |
    array('hash' => array('name' => 'Steve', 'foo' => 'bar'))

test: Multi-line Inline Collections
todo: true
brief: >
    Both inline sequences and inline mappings
    can span multiple lines, provided that you
    indent the additional lines.
yaml: |
    languages: [ Ruby,
                 Perl,
                 Python ]
    websites: { YAML: yaml.org,
                Ruby: ruby-lang.org,
                Python: python.org,
                Perl: use.perl.org }
php: |
    array(
      'languages' => array('Ruby', 'Perl', 'Python'),
      'websites' => array(
        'YAML' => 'yaml.org',
        'Ruby' => 'ruby-lang.org',
        'Python' => 'python.org',
        'Perl' => 'use.perl.org'
      )
    )

test: Commas in Values (not in the spec!)
todo: true
brief: >
    List items in collections are delimited by commas, but
    there must be a space after each comma.  This allows you
    to add numbers without quoting.
yaml: |
    attendances: [ 45,123, 70,000, 17,222 ]
php: |
    array('attendances' => array(45123, 70000, 17222))
