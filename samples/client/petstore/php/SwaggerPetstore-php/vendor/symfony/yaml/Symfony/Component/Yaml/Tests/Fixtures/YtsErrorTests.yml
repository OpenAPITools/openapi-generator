test: Not indenting enough
brief: |
    There was a bug in PyYaml where it was off by one
    in the indentation check.  It was allowing the YAML
    below.
# This is actually valid YAML now. Someone should tell showell.
yaml: |
    foo:
    firstline: 1
    secondline: 2
php: |
  array('foo' => null, 'firstline' => 1, 'secondline' => 2)
