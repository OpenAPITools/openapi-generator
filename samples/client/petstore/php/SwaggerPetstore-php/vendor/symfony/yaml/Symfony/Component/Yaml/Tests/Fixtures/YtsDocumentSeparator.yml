test: Trailing Document Separator
todo: true
brief: >
    You can separate YAML documents
    with a string of three dashes.
yaml: |
    - foo: 1
      bar: 2
    ---
    more: stuff
python: |
    [
        [ { 'foo': 1, 'bar': 2 } ],
        { 'more': 'stuff' }
    ]
ruby: |
    [ { 'foo' => 1, 'bar' => 2 } ]

---
test: Leading Document Separator
todo: true
brief: >
    You can explicity give an opening
    document separator to your YAML stream.
yaml: |
    ---
    - foo: 1
      bar: 2
    ---
    more: stuff
python: |
    [
        [ {'foo': 1, 'bar': 2}],
        {'more': 'stuff'}
    ]
ruby: |
    [ { 'foo' => 1, 'bar' => 2 } ]

test: YAML Header
todo: true
brief: >
    The opening separator can contain directives
    to the YAML parser, such as the version
    number.
yaml: |
    --- %YAML:1.0
    foo: 1
    bar: 2
php: |
    array('foo' => 1, 'bar' => 2)
documents: 1

---
test: Red Herring Document Separator
brief: >
    Separators included in blocks or strings
    are treated as blocks or strings, as the
    document separator should have no indentation
    preceding it.
yaml: |
    foo: |
        ---
php: |
    array('foo' => "---\n")

---
test: Multiple Document Separators in Block
brief: >
    This technique allows you to embed other YAML
    documents within literal blocks.
yaml: |
    foo: |
        ---
        foo: bar
        ---
        yo: baz
    bar: |
        fooness
php: |
    array(
       'foo' => "---\nfoo: bar\n---\nyo: baz\n",
       'bar' => "fooness\n"
    )
