test: Simple Alias Example
brief: >
    If you need to refer to the same item of data twice,
    you can give that item an alias.  The alias is a plain
    string, starting with an ampersand.  The item may then
    be referred to by the alias throughout your document
    by using an asterisk before the name of the alias.
    This is called an anchor.
yaml: |
    - &showell Steve
    - Clark
    - Brian
    - Oren
    - *showell
php: |
    array('Steve', 'Clark', 'Brian', 'Oren', 'Steve')
