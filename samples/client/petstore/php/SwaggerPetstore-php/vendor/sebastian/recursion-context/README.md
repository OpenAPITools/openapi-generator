# Recursion Context

...

## Installation

To add Recursion Context as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a dependency on `sebastian/recursion-context` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a dependency on Recursion Context 1.0:

    {
        "require": {
            "sebastian/recursion-context": "~1.0"
        }
    }
