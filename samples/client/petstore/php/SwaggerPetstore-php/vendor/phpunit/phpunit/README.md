## Installation

We distribute a [PHP Archive (PHAR)](http://php.net/phar) that has all required (as well as some optional) dependencies of PHPUnit bundled in a single file:

    wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar
    chmod +x phpunit.phar
    mv phpunit.phar /usr/local/bin/phpunit

You can also immediately use the PHAR after you have downloaded it, of course:

    wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar
    php phpunit.phar

Alternatively, you may use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to download and install PHPUnit as well as its dependencies. Please refer to the [documentation](https://phpunit.de/documentation.html) for details on how to do this.
