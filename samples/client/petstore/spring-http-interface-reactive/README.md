# OpenAPI generated API stub

[Spring Framework 6.1 HTTP Interface](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.1.0/reference/html/integration.html#rest-http-interface)


## Overview
This code was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate an API stub.
This is an example of building API stub interfaces in Java using the Spring framework.

The stubs generated can be used in your existing Spring application for HTTP integration with other REST services
To use auto-generated interfaces you have to create your own configuration which extends default abstract configurator & provide `WebClient` instance via constructor
```java
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration extends org.openapitools.configuration.HttpInterfacesAbstractConfigurator {

    public MyConfiguration(WebClient client) {
        super(client);
    }
}
```
