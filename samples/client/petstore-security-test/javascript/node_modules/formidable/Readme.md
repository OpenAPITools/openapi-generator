# Formidable

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/felixge/node-formidable.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-formidable)

## Purpose

A node.js module for parsing form data, especially file uploads.

## Current status

This module was developed for [Transloadit](http://transloadit.com/), a service focused on uploading
and encoding images and videos. It has been battle-tested against hundreds of GB of file uploads from
a large variety of clients and is considered production-ready.

## Features

* Fast (~500mb/sec), non-buffering multipart parser
* Automatically writing file uploads to disk
* Low memory footprint
* Graceful error handling
* Very high test coverage

## Installation

This is a low level package, and if you're using a high level framework such as Express, chances are it's already included in it. You can [read this discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11295554/how-to-disable-express-bodyparser-for-file-uploads-node-js) about how Formidable is integrated with Express.

Via [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):
```
npm install formidable@latest
```
Manually:
```
git clone git://github.com/felixge/node-formidable.git formidable
vim my.js
# var formidable = require('./formidable');
```

Note: Formidable requires [gently](http://github.com/felixge/node-gently) to run the unit tests, but you won't need it for just using the library.

## Example

Parse an incoming file upload.
```javascript
var formidable = require('formidable'),
    http = require('http'),
    util = require('util');

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  if (req.url == '/upload' && req.method.toLowerCase() == 'post') {
    // parse a file upload
    var form = new formidable.IncomingForm();

    form.parse(req, function(err, fields, files) {
      res.writeHead(200, {'content-type': 'text/plain'});
      res.write('received upload:\n\n');
      res.end(util.inspect({fields: fields, files: files}));
    });

    return;
  }

  // show a file upload form
  res.writeHead(200, {'content-type': 'text/html'});
  res.end(
    '<form action="/upload" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">'+
    '<input type="text" name="title"><br>'+
    '<input type="file" name="upload" multiple="multiple"><br>'+
    '<input type="submit" value="Upload">'+
    '</form>'
  );
}).listen(8080);
```
## API

### Formidable.IncomingForm
```javascript
var form = new formidable.IncomingForm()
```
Creates a new incoming form.

```javascript
form.encoding = 'utf-8';
```
Sets encoding for incoming form fields.

```javascript
form.uploadDir = "/my/dir";
```
Sets the directory for placing file uploads in. You can move them later on using
`fs.rename()`. The default is `os.tmpDir()`.

```javascript
form.keepExtensions = false;
```
If you want the files written to `form.uploadDir` to include the extensions of the original files, set this property to `true`.

```javascript
form.type
```
Either 'multipart' or 'urlencoded' depending on the incoming request.

```javascript
form.maxFieldsSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024;
```
Limits the amount of memory all fields together (except files) can allocate in bytes.
If this value is exceeded, an `'error'` event is emitted. The default
size is 2MB.

```javascript
form.maxFields = 1000;
```
Limits the number of fields that the querystring parser will decode. Defaults
to 1000 (0 for unlimited).

```javascript
form.hash = false;
```
If you want checksums calculated for incoming files, set this to either `'sha1'` or `'md5'`.

```javascript
form.multiples = false;
```
If this option is enabled, when you call `form.parse`, the `files` argument will contain arrays of files for inputs which submit multiple files using the HTML5 `multiple` attribute.

```javascript
form.bytesReceived
```
The amount of bytes received for this form so far.

```javascript
form.bytesExpected
```
The expected number of bytes in this form.

```javascript
form.parse(request, [cb]);
```
Parses an incoming node.js `request` containing form data. If `cb` is provided, all fields and files are collected and passed to the callback:


```javascript
form.parse(req, function(err, fields, files) {
  // ...
});

form.onPart(part);
```
You may overwrite this method if you are interested in directly accessing the multipart stream. Doing so will disable any `'field'` / `'file'` events  processing which would occur otherwise, making you fully responsible for handling the processing.

```javascript
form.onPart = function(part) {
  part.addListener('data', function() {
    // ...
  });
}
```
If you want to use formidable to only handle certain parts for you, you can do so:
```javascript
form.onPart = function(part) {
  if (!part.filename) {
    // let formidable handle all non-file parts
    form.handlePart(part);
  }
}
```
Check the code in this method for further inspiration.


### Formidable.File
```javascript
file.size = 0
```
The size of the uploaded file in bytes. If the file is still being uploaded (see `'fileBegin'` event), this property says how many bytes of the file have been written to disk yet.
```javascript
file.path = null
```
The path this file is being written to. You can modify this in the `'fileBegin'` event in
case you are unhappy with the way formidable generates a temporary path for your files.
```javascript
file.name = null
```
The name this file had according to the uploading client.
```javascript
file.type = null
```
The mime type of this file, according to the uploading client.
```javascript
file.lastModifiedDate = null
```
A date object (or `null`) containing the time this file was last written to. Mostly
here for compatibility with the [W3C File API Draft](http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/FileAPI/).
```javascript
file.hash = null
```
If hash calculation was set, you can read the hex digest out of this var.

#### Formidable.File#toJSON()

  This method returns a JSON-representation of the file, allowing you to
  `JSON.stringify()` the file which is useful for logging and responding
  to requests.

### Events


#### 'progress'
```javascript
form.on('progress', function(bytesReceived, bytesExpected) {
});
```
Emitted after each incoming chunk of data that has been parsed. Can be used to roll your own progress bar.



#### 'field'
```javascript
form.on('field', function(name, value) {
});
```

#### 'fileBegin'

Emitted whenever a field / value pair has been received.
```javascript
form.on('fileBegin', function(name, file) {
});
```

#### 'file'

Emitted whenever a new file is detected in the upload stream. Use this even if
you want to stream the file to somewhere else while buffering the upload on
the file system.

Emitted whenever a field / file pair has been received. `file` is an instance of `File`.
```javascript
form.on('file', function(name, file) {
});
```

#### 'error'

Emitted when there is an error processing the incoming form. A request that experiences an error is automatically paused, you will have to manually call `request.resume()` if you want the request to continue firing `'data'` events.
```javascript
form.on('error', function(err) {
});
```

#### 'aborted'


Emitted when the request was aborted by the user. Right now this can be due to a 'timeout' or 'close' event on the socket. After this event is emitted, an `error` event will follow. In the future there will be a separate 'timeout' event (needs a change in the node core).
```javascript
form.on('aborted', function() {
});
```

##### 'end'
```javascript
form.on('end', function() {
});
```
Emitted when the entire request has been received, and all contained files have finished flushing to disk. This is a great place for you to send your response.
