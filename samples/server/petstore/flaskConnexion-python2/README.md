# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
sudo pip install -U connexion # install Connexion from PyPI
python app.py
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v2/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v2/swagger.json
```
