    views do not have to return response objects but can return a value that
    is converted into a response object by Flask itself, it becomes tricky to
    add headers to it.  This function can be called instead of using a return
    and you will get a response object which you can use to attach headers.

    If view looked like this and you want to add a new header::

        def index():
            return render_template('index.html', foo=42)

    You can now do something like this::

        def index():

            response.headers['X-Parachutes'] = 'parachutes are cool'

    This function accepts the very same arguments you can return from a
    view function.  This for example creates a response with a 404 error
    code::

        response = make_response(render_template('not_found.html'), 404)

    The other use case of this function is to force the return value of a
    view function into a response which is helpful with view
    decorators::

        response = make_response(view_function())
        response.headers['X-Parachutes'] = 'parachutes are cool'

    Internally this function does the following things:

    -   if no arguments are passed, it creates a new response argument
    -   if one argument is passed, :meth:`flask.Flask.make_response`
        is invoked with it.
    -   if more than one argument is passed, the arguments are passed
        to the :meth:`flask.Flask.make_response` function as tuple.

    is ``None``, the whole pair is skipped.  In case blueprints are active
    you can shortcut references to the same blueprint by prefixing the
    local endpoint with a dot (``.``).

    This will reference the index function local to the current blueprint::

        url_for('.index')

    For more information, head over to the :ref:`Quickstart <url-building>`.

    To integrate applications, :class:`Flask` has a hook to intercept URL build
    errors through :attr:`Flask.url_build_error_handlers`.  The `url_for`
    function results in a :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError` when the current
    app does not have a URL for the given endpoint and values.  When it does, the
    :data:`~flask.current_app` calls its :attr:`~Flask.url_build_error_handlers` if
    it is not ``None``, which can return a string to use as the result of
    `url_for` (instead of `url_for`'s default to raise the
    :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError` exception) or re-raise the exception.
    An example::

        def external_url_handler(error, endpoint, values):
            "Looks up an external URL when `url_for` cannot build a URL."
            # This is an example of hooking the build_error_handler.
            # Here, lookup_url is some utility function you've built
            # which looks up the endpoint in some external URL registry.
            url = lookup_url(endpoint, **values)
            if url is None:
                # External lookup did not have a URL.
                # Re-raise the BuildError, in context of original traceback.
                exc_type, exc_value, tb = sys.exc_info()
                if exc_value is error:
                    raise exc_type, exc_value, tb

            # url_for will use this result, instead of raising BuildError.
            return url

        app.url_build_error_handlers.append(external_url_handler)

    Here, `error` is the instance of :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError`, and
    `endpoint` and `values` are the arguments passed into `url_for`.  Note
    that this is for building URLs outside the current application, and not for
