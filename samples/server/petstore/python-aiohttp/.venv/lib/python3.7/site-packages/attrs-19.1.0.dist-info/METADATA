.. teaser-begin

``attrs`` is the Python package that will bring back the **joy** of **writing classes** by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka `dunder <https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200605/dunder.html>`_ methods).

Its main goal is to help you to write **concise** and **correct** software without slowing down your code.

.. -spiel-end-

For that, it gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:

.. -code-begin-

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> import attr

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class SomeClass(object):
   ...     a_number = attr.ib(default=42)
   ...     list_of_numbers = attr.ib(factory=list)
   ...
   ...     def hard_math(self, another_number):
   ...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number


   >>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   >>> sc
   SomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])

   >>> sc.hard_math(3)
   19
   >>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   True
   >>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])
   True

   >>> attr.asdict(sc)
   {'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}

   >>> SomeClass()
   SomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])

   >>> C = attr.make_class("C", ["a", "b"])
   >>> C("foo", "bar")
   C(a='foo', b='bar')


After *declaring* your attributes ``attrs`` gives you:

- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,
- a nice human-readable ``__repr__``,
- a complete set of comparison methods,
- an initializer,
- and much more,

*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.

On Python 3.6 and later, you can often even drop the calls to ``attr.ib()`` by using `type annotations <https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/types.html>`_.

This gives you the power to use actual classes with actual types in your code instead of confusing ``tuple``\ s or `confusingly behaving <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#namedtuples>`_ ``namedtuple``\ s.
Which in turn encourages you to write *small classes* that do `one thing well <https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries>`_.
Never again violate the `single responsibility principle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle>`_ just because implementing ``__init__`` et al is a painful drag.

Testimonials
============

**Amber Hawkie Brown**, Twisted Release Manager and Computer Owl:

  Writing a fully-functional class using attrs takes me less time than writing this testimonial.


**Glyph Lefkowitz**, creator of `Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/>`_, `Automat <https://pypi.org/project/Automat/>`_, and other open source software, in `The One Python Library Everyone Needs <https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2016/08/attrs.html>`_:

  I’m looking forward to is being able to program in Python-with-attrs everywhere.
  It exerts a subtle, but positive, design influence in all the codebases I’ve see it used in.


**Kenneth Reitz**, author of `Requests <http://www.python-requests.org/>`_ and Developer Advocate at DigitalOcean, (`on paper no less <https://twitter.com/hynek/status/866817877650751488>`_!):

  attrs—classes for humans.  I like it.


**Łukasz Langa**, prolific CPython core developer and Production Engineer at Facebook:

  I'm increasingly digging your attr.ocity. Good job!

Release Information
===================

19.1.0 (2019-03-03)
-------------------

Backward-incompatible Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed a bug where deserialized objects with ``cache_hash=True`` could have incorrect hash code values.
  This change breaks classes with ``cache_hash=True`` when a custom ``__setstate__`` is present.
  An exception will be thrown when applying the ``attrs`` annotation to such a class.
  This limitation is tracked in issue `#494 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/494>`_.
  `#482 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/482>`_


Changes
^^^^^^^

- Add ``is_callable``, ``deep_iterable``, and ``deep_mapping`` validators.

  * ``is_callable``: validates that a value is callable
  * ``deep_iterable``: Allows recursion down into an iterable,
    applying another validator to every member in the iterable
    as well as applying an optional validator to the iterable itself.
  * ``deep_mapping``: Allows recursion down into the items in a mapping object,
    applying a key validator and a value validator to the key and value in every item.
    Also applies an optional validator to the mapping object itself.

  You can find them in the ``attr.validators`` package.
  `#425 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/425>`_
- Fixed stub files to prevent errors raised by mypy's ``disallow_any_generics = True`` option.
  `#443 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/443>`_
- Attributes with ``init=False`` now can follow after ``kw_only=True`` attributes.
  `#450 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/450>`_
- ``attrs`` now has first class support for defining exception classes.

  If you define a class using ``@attr.s(auto_exc=True)`` and subclass an exception, the class will behave like a well-behaved exception class including an appropriate ``__str__`` method, and all attributes additionally available in an ``args`` attribute.
  `#500 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/500>`_
- Clarified documentation for hashing to warn that hashable objects should be deeply immutable (in their usage, even if this is not enforced).
  `#503 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/503>`_

`Full changelog <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/changelog.html>`_.

Credits
=======

``attrs`` is written and maintained by `Hynek Schlawack <https://hynek.me/>`_.

The development is kindly supported by `Variomedia AG <https://www.variomedia.de/>`_.

A full list of contributors can be found in `GitHub's overview <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/graphs/contributors>`_.

It’s the spiritual successor of `characteristic <https://characteristic.readthedocs.io/>`_ and aspires to fix some of it clunkiness and unfortunate decisions.
Both were inspired by Twisted’s `FancyEqMixin <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.util.FancyEqMixin.html>`_ but both are implemented using class decorators because `subclassing is bad for you <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNVP9-hglc>`_, m’kay?
