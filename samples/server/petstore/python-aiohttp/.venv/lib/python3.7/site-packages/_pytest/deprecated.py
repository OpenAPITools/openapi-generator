"""
This module contains deprecation messages and bits of code used elsewhere in the codebase
that is planned to be removed in the next pytest release.

Keeping it in a central location makes it easy to track what is deprecated and should
be removed when the time comes.

All constants defined in this module should be either PytestWarning instances or UnformattedWarning
in case of warnings which need to format their messages.
