# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://www.openapis.org/) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub. This
is an example of building a PHP server.

This example uses the [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) micro-framework. To see how to make this your own, please take a look at the template here:
