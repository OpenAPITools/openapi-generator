# JAX-RS server with OpenAPI

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using an
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.

This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled JAX-RS server.
This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.

This project produces a jar that defines some interfaces.
The jar can be used in combination with another project providing the implementation.
