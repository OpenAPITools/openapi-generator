# Swagger generated server

Spring MVC Server


## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the Spring MVC framework.

The underlying library integrating swagger to Spring-MVC is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)

You can view the server in swagger-ui by pointing to
http://localhost:8002/v2/swagger-ui.html
