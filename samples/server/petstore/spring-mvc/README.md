# OpenAPI generated server

Spring MVC Server


## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.  This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled server in Java using the Spring MVC framework.

The underlying library integrating OpenAPI to Spring-MVC is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)

You can view the server in swagger-ui by pointing to
http://localhost:80/v2/
