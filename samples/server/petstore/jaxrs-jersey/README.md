# JAX-RS/Jersey server with OpenAPI

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using an
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.

This is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled JAX-RS server.
This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.
Jersey is used as JAX-RS implementation, `io.swagger:swagger-jersey2-jaxrs` is used to derive the OpenAPI Specification from the annotated code.

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run
```

You can then view the OpenAPI v2 specification here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v2/swagger.json
```

Note that if you have configured the `host` to be something other than localhost, the calls through
swagger-ui will be directed to that host and not localhost!
