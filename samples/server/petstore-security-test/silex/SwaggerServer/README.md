# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a PHP server.

This example uses the [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) micro-framework.  To see how to make this your own, please take a look at the template here:
