[Slim Framework Documentation](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/)

## Requirements

* Web server with URL rewriting
* PHP 5.5 or newer

This package contains `.htaccess` for Apache configuration.
If you use another server(Nginx, HHVM, IIS, lighttpd) check out [Web Servers](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v3/start/web-servers.html) doc.

## Installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

Navigate into your project's root directory and execute the bash command shown below.
This command downloads the Slim Framework and its third-party dependencies into your project's `vendor/` directory.
```bash
$ composer install
```

## Start devserver

Run the following command in terminal to start localhost web server, assuming `./php-slim-server/` is public-accessible directory with `index.php` file:
```bash
$ php -S localhost:8888 -t php-slim-server
```
> **Warning** This web server was designed to aid application development.
> It may also be useful for testing purposes or for application demonstrations that are run in controlled environments.
> It is not intended to be a full-featured web server. It should not be used on a public network.

## Run tests

This package uses PHPUnit 4.8 for unit testing.
[Test folder](test) contains templates which you can fill with real test assertions.
How to write tests read at [PHPUnit Manual - Chapter 2. Writing Tests for PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/manual/4.8/en/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html).
