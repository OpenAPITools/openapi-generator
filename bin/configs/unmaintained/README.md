# Unmaintained Sample Configs

These are legacy configs which are no longer maintained. This means:

- They are not automatically generated when using the `./bin/generate-samples.sh` command (unless you manually specify 
  the paths)
- The merge checks will not ensure that the corresponding samples have been generated or are up-to-date.
- The sample code currently in Git is unlikely to be up-to-date.
