# Swagger Code Generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.png)](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)

## Overview
This is the swagger codegen project, which allows generation of client libraries automatically from a Swagger-compliant server.  

## What's Swagger?

The goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.


Check out [Swagger-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) for additional information about the Swagger project, including additional libraries with support for other languages and more. 


## Compatability
The Swagger Specification has undergone 3 revisions since initial creation in 2010.  The swagger-codegen project has the following compatibilies with the swagger specification:

### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

* [Java 7](http://java.oracle.com)

* [Apache maven 3.0.3 or greater](http://maven.apache.org/)

After cloning the project, you can build it from source with this command:

```
mvn package
```

### To generate a sample client library
You can build a client against the swagger sample [petstore](http://petstore.swagger.io) API as follows:

```
./bin/java-petstore.sh
```

This will run the generator with this command:

```
java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-distribution/target/swagger-codegen-distribution-2.1.3-M1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  -i http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json \
  -l java \
  -o samples/client/petstore/java
```

With a number of options.  You can get the options with the -h flag:
```
usage: Codegen
 -a,--auth                 addes authorization headers when fetching the
                           swagger definitions remotely. Pass in a
                           URL-encoded string of name:header with a comma
                           separating multiple values
 -d,--debug-info           prints additional info for debugging
 -h,--help                 shows this message
 -i,--input-spec <arg>     location of the swagger spec, as URL or file
 -l,--lang <arg>           client language to generate.
                           Available languages include:
                           [android, java, jaxrs, nodejs, objc, scalatra,
                           scala, dynamic-html, html, swagger, tizen, php,
                           python]
 -o,--output <arg>         where to write the generated files
 -t,--template-dir <arg>   folder containing the template files
 ```

You can then compile and run the client, as well as unit tests against it:

```
cd samples/client/petstore/java
mvn package
```

Other languages have petstore samples, too:
```
./bin/android-petstore.sh
./bin/java-petstore.sh
./bin/objc-petstore.sh
```

### Generating libraries from your server
It's just as easy--just use the `-i` flag to point to either a server or file.

### Modifying the client library format
Don't like the default swagger client syntax?  Want a different language supported?  No problem!  Swagger codegen processes mustache templates with the [jmustache](https://github.com/samskivert/jmustache) engine.  You can modify our templates or make your own.

You can look at `modules/swagger-codegen/src/main/resources/${your-language}` for examples.  To make your own templates, create your own files and use the `-t` flag to specify your tempalte folder.  It actually is that easy.

### Making your own codegen modules
If you're starting a project with a new language and don't see what you need, swagger-codegen can help you create a project to generate your own libraries:

```
java -cp modules/swagger-codegen-distribution/target/swagger-codegen-distribution-2.1.3-M1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  com.wordnik.swagger.codegen.MetaGenerator \
  -o output/myLibrary -n myClientCodegen -p com.my.company.codegen
```

This will write, in the folder `output/myLibrary`, all the files you need to get started, including a README.md.  Once modified and compiled, you can load your library with the codegen and generate clients with your own, custom-rolled logic.

### Where is Javascript???
See our [javascript library](http://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js)--it's completely dynamic and doesn't require
static code generation.
There is a third-party component called [swagger-js-codegen](https://github.com/wcandillon/swagger-js-codegen) that can generate angularjs or nodejs source code from a swagger specification.


#### Generating a client from flat files (i.e. no remote server calls)
If you don't want to call your server, you can save the swagger spec files into a directory and pass an argument
to the code generator like this:

```
-i ./modules/swagger-codegen/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.json
```

Great for creating libraries on your ci server, from the [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io)... or while coding on an airplane.

### Customizing the generator

There are different aspects of customizing the code generator beyond just creating or modifying templates.  Each language has a supporting configuration file to handle different type mappings, etc:

```
$ ls -1 modules/swagger-codegen/src/main/java/com/wordnik/swagger/codegen/languages/
AndroidClientCodegen.java
JavaClientCodegen.java
JaxRSServerCodegen.java
NodeJSServerCodegen.java
ObjcClientCodegen.java
PhpClientCodegen.java
PythonClientCodegen.java
ScalaClientCodegen.java
ScalatraServerCodegen.java
StaticDocCodegen.java
StaticHtmlGenerator.java
SwaggerGenerator.java
TizenClientCodegen.java
```

Each of these files creates reasonable defaults so you can get running quickly.  But if you want to configure package names, prefixes, model folders, etc., you may want to extend these.

To change, for example, the prefix for the Objective-C generated files, simply subclass the ObjcClientCodegen.java:

```
package com.mycompany.swagger.codegen;

import com.wordnik.swagger.codegen.languages.*;

public class MyObjcCodegen extends ObjcClientCodegen {
  static {
    PREFIX = "HELO";
  }
}
```

and specify the `classname` when running the generator:

```
-l com.mycompany.swagger.codegen.MyObjcCodegen
```

Your subclass will now be loaded and overrides the `PREFIX` value in the superclass.

### Validating your swagger spec

You have options.  The easiest is to use our [online validator](https://github.com/swagger-api/validator-badge) which not only will let you validate your spec, but with the debug flag, you can see what's wrong with your spec.  For example:

http://online.swagger.io/validator/debug?url=http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json

### Generating dynamic html api documentation

To do so, just use the `-l dynamic-html` flag when reading a spec file.  This creates HTML documentation that is available as a single-page application with AJAX.  To view the documentation:

```
cd samples/dynamic-html/
npm install
node .
```

Which launches a node.js server so the AJAX calls have a place to go.


### Generating static html api documentation

To do so, just use the `-l html` flag when reading a spec file.  This creates a single, simple HTML file with embedded css so you can ship it as an email attachment, or load it from your filesystem:

```
cd samples/html/
open index.html
```


### To build a server stub

You can also use the codegen to generate a server for a couple different frameworks.  Take a look here:

### node.js
```
java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-distribution/target/swagger-codegen-distribution-2.1.3-M1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  -i http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json \
  -l nodejs \
  -o samples/server/petstore/nodejs
```

### rails-grape
#### Not yet migrated to this branch


### scala scalatra
```
java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-distribution/target/swagger-codegen-distribution-2.1.3-M1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  -i http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json \
  -l scalatra \
  -o samples/server/petstore/scalatra
```

### java jax-rs

```
java -jar modules/swagger-codegen-distribution/target/swagger-codegen-distribution-2.1.3-M1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  -i http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json \
  -l jaxrs \
  -o samples/server/petstore/jaxrs
```

### To build the codegen library

This will create the swagger-codegen library from source.  

```
mvn package
```

Note!  The templates are included in the library generated.  If you want to modify the templates, you'll need to either repackage the library OR specify a path to your scripts
