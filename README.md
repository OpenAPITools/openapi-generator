# Swagger Code Generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.png)](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)

## Overview
This is the swagger codegen project, which allows generation of client libraries automatically from a 
Swagger-compliant server.  

## What's Swagger?

The goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.


Check out [Swagger-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) for additional information about the Swagger project, including additional libraries with support for other languages and more. 


## Compatibility
The Swagger Specification has undergone 3 revisions since initial creation in 2010. Compatibility between swagger-codegen and the Swagger specification is as follows:

Swagger Codegen Version | Release Date | Swagger Spec compatibility | Notes
----------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- | -----
2.1.0 (in development)  | n/a          | 2.0           | [branch develop_2.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/develop_2.0)
2.0.17                  | 2014-08-22   | 1.1, 1.2      | [tag v2.0.17](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/2.0.17)
1.0.4                   | 2012-04-12   | 1.0, 1.1      | [tag v1.0.4](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/swagger-codegen_2.9.1-1.1)


### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

* [Java 1.7](http://java.oracle.com)

Note!  Some folks have had issues with OOM errors with java version "1.6.0_51".  It's strongly suggested that you upgrade to 1.7!

* [Apache maven 3.0.3 or greater](http://maven.apache.org/)

* [Scala 2.10.4](http://www.scala-lang.org)

* [sbt (only download if you're building on Windows)](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

You also need to add the scala binary to your PATH.

After cloning the project, you need to build it from source with this command:

```
./sbt assembly
```

or for Windows...

```
sbt assembly
```


### To generate a sample client library
You can build a client against Wordnik's [petstore](http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com) API as follows:

```
./bin/scala-petstore.sh
```

This will run the script in [samples/client/petstore/ScalaPetstoreCodegen.scala](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/blob/master/samples/client/petstore/scala/ScalaPetstoreCodegen.scala) and create the client.  You can then
compile and run the client, as well as unit tests against it:

```
cd samples/client/petstore/scala
mvn package
```

Other languages have petstore samples, too:
```
./bin/flash-petstore.sh
./bin/java-petstore.sh
./bin/objc-petstore.sh
./bin/php-petstore.sh
./bin/python-petstore.sh
./bin/python3-petstore.sh
./bin/ruby-petstore.sh
```

### Generating libraries from your server
It's just as easy--you can either run the default generators:

```
./bin/runscala.sh com.wordnik.swagger.codegen.BasicScalaGenerator http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs special-key
```

Replace `Scala` with `Flash`, `Java`, `Objc`, `PHP`, `Python`, `Python3`, `Ruby`.

You will probably want to override some of the defaults--like packages, etc.  For doing this, just create a scala
script with the overrides you want.  Follow [ScalaPetstoreCodegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/blob/master/samples/client/petstore/scala/ScalaPetstoreCodegen.scala) as an example:

For example, create `src/main/scala/MyCodegen.scala` with these contents:

```scala
import com.wordnik.swagger.codegen.BasicScalaGenerator

object MyCodegen extends BasicScalaGenerator {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = generateClient(args)

  // location of templates
  override def templateDir = "scala"

  // where to write generated code
  override def destinationDir = "client/scala/src/main/scala"

  // api invoker package
  override def invokerPackage = "com.myapi.client"

  // package for models
  override def modelPackage = Some("com.myapi.client.model")

  // package for api classes
  override def apiPackage = Some("com.myapi.client.api")

  // supporting classes
  override def supportingFiles = List(
    ("apiInvoker.mustache", destinationDir + java.io.File.separator + packageName.replaceAll("\\.", java.io.File.separator), "ApiInvoker.scala"),
    ("pom.mustache", destinationDir, "pom.xml")
  )
}
```

Now you can generate your client like this:

```
./bin/runscala.sh src/main/scala/MyCodegen.scala http://my.api.com/resources.json super-secret-key
```

w00t!  Thanks to the scala interpretor, you didn't even need to recompile.

### Modifying the client library format
Don't like the default swagger client syntax?  Want a different language supported?  No problem!  Swagger codegen
processes mustache templates with the [scalate](http://scalate.fusesource.org/) engine.  You can modify our templates or
make your own.

You can look at `src/main/resources/${your-language}` for examples.  To make your own templates, create your own files
and override the `templateDir` in your script to point to the right place.  It actually is that easy.

### Where is Javascript???
See our [javascript library](http://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js)--it's completely dynamic and doesn't require
static code generation.
There is a third-party component called [swagger-js-codegen](https://github.com/wcandillon/swagger-js-codegen) that can generate angularjs or nodejs source code from a swagger specification.


#### Generating a client from flat files (i.e. no remote server calls)
If you don't want to call your server, you can save the swagger spec files into a directory and pass an argument
to the code generator like this:

```
-DfileMap=/path/to/resource-listing
```

Or for example:
```
./bin/java-petstore-filemap.sh
```

Which simple passes `-DfileMap=src/test/resources/petstore` as an argument.  Great for creating libraries on your
ci server... or while coding on an airplane.

### Validating your swagger spec
You can use the validation tool to see that your server is creating a proper spec file.  If you want to learn
more about the spec file and format, please see [swagger-core](https://github.com/swagger-spec).  This
tool will read the server and generate a report of any violations of the spec.  If there are violations, the
client codegen and ui may not work correctly.

To validate an api and write output to ./swagger-errors.html:

```
./bin/validate.sh http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/api/api-docs "specia-key" ./swagger-errors.html
```

### Generating static api documentation
If you need to make static pages or don't want the sandbox of the swagger-ui, you can use the codegen to build them.  Remember, the engine is just using mustache templates--the output format is your call.

```
./bin/static-docs.sh
```

Will produce the output here:

```
https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/samples/swagger-static-docs/docs
```

which is based on these templates:

```
https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/src/main/resources/swagger-static
```

and looks like this

### To build a server stub

You can also use the codegen to generate a server for a couple different frameworks.  Take a look here:

* [javascript node.js Server generator](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/samples/server-generator/node)

* [ruby sinatra generator](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/samples/server-generator/sinatra)

* [scala scalatra generator](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/samples/server-generator/scalatra)

* [java jax-rs generator](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/samples/server-generator/java-jaxrs)


### Migrating from Swagger 1.1 to 1.2 format

If you've spent time hand-crafting your swagger spec files, you can use the [SpecConverter](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/wordnik/swagger/codegen/SpecConverter.scala) to do the dirty work.  For example:

```bash
$ ./bin/update-spec.sh http://developer.wordnik.com/v4/resources.json wordnik-developer
writing file wordnik-developer/api-docs
calling: http://developer.wordnik.com/v4/account.json
calling: http://developer.wordnik.com/v4/word.json
calling: http://developer.wordnik.com/v4/words.json
calling: http://developer.wordnik.com/v4/wordList.json
calling: http://developer.wordnik.com/v4/wordLists.json
writing file wordnik-developer/account
writing file wordnik-developer/word
writing file wordnik-developer/words
writing file wordnik-developer/wordList
writing file wordnik-developer/wordLists
```

Will read the 1.1 spec from wordnik developer and write it into the folder called `wordnik-developer`.


### To build the codegen library

This will create the swagger-codegen library from source.  

```
./sbt assembly
```

Note!  The templates are included in the library generated.  If you want to modify the templates, you'll need to
either repackage the library OR modify your codegen script to use a file path!
